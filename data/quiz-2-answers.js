    1: {
        id: "1",
        "answer": "Java",
        "reason": "Java is primarily an object oriented programming language."
    },
    2: {
        id: "2",
        "answer": ";",
        "reason": "You must end every line of Java code with ';'"
    },
    3: {
        id: "3",
        "answer": "False",
        "reason": "Although there are similarities, they are both different. Java is more for client side applications whereas Javascript is primarily for web development."
    },
    4: {
        id: "4",
        "answer": "False",
        "reason": "To declare variables in Java, you must declare the variable's type. Which includes, int, double, String, etc."
    },
    5: {
        id: "5",
        "answer": "Scanner",
        "reason": "The Scanner package allows for the retrieval of user input."
    },
    6: {
        id: "6",
        "answer": "System.out.print()",
        "reason": "System.out.print() is used to print to the console in Java."
    },
    7: {
        id: "7",
        "answer": "print()",
        "reason": "print() in Python prints to the console."
    },
    8: {
        id: "8",
        "answer": "x++",
        "reason": "x++ is shorter syntax for x+1 that is frequently used when you need to increment a variable by 1."
    },
    9: {
        id: "9",
        "answer": "False",
        "reason": "Java and Python are neither better nor worse than each other. Both languages have their own unique strengths and weaknesses."
    },
    10: {
        id: "10",
        "answer": "True",
        "reason": "In Python, it is unnecessary to delcare a variable. There is actually no way to declare a variable in Python."
    },
    11: {
        id: "11",
        "answer": "./assets/pictures/cs/addition.png",
        "reason": "To get the sum, you must keep adding the values of the array into the variable total."
    },
    12: {
        id: "12",
        "answer": "def",
        "reason": "To declare a function in Python, you must use def myFunc():"
    },
    13: {
        id: "13",
        "answer": ["object", "class"],
        "reason": ["You create an object of a class", "A class is a blueprint for an object"]
    },
    14: {
        id: "14",
        "answer": "input()",
        "reason": "In Python, the function method input() retrieves user input."
    },
    15: {
        id: "15",
        "answer": "./assets/pictures/cs/python syntax 1.png",
        "reason": "In Python, if statements use a capitalized 't' in True and Python also uses ':' instead of '{}'."
    },
    16: {
        id: "16",
        "answer": "./assets/pictures/cs/java syntax.png",
        "reason": "Unlike Python, Java uses if(condition) {body}. So, you need to remember the parenthesis around the condition and the curly braces around the body of the if statement."
    },
    17: {
        id: "17",
        "answer": ["==", "and", "==", ":", "else"],
        "reason": ["To make the first condition True, x=2 so if x==2, then it would be true", "To concatenate two conditions you need to use the key word and to make sure both conditions are True", "To make the second condition True, since y=5, then you need to test if y==5", "You need a colon ':' at the end of an if statment", "To handle any False conditions, you need to use an else statement"]
    },
    18: {
        id: "18",
        "answer": "0",
        "reason": "The for loop runs 10 times and continously subtracts 10 each from from 100, which makes total = 0."
    },
    19: {
        id: "19",
        "answer": "5",
        "reason": "In order for the if statement to print out 'same' you would need x to equal 5, so 5 is the answer."
    },
    20: {
        id: "20",
        "answer": ["for", "in", "range", "2"],
        "reason": ["You need to declare a for loop using the keyword for", "In a for loop, you need to use the keyword in to declare which value is the iterator", "Range, declares an interator of length 5", "Multiplying the variable answer by the number 2 is the same as doing 2*2*2*2*2"]
