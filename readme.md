<ul>
<li>I created a form that gets the user’s name as well as the quiz that they want to take</li>
<li>The users are allowed to choose between “Web Development” quiz or “General Computer Science” quiz</li>
<li>When the user starts the quiz, the application retrieves the questions asynchronously from the JSONPlaceholder.</li>
<li>Each quiz has 20 questions with 5 different question types: multiple choice, fill in the blank, short answer, pictures, true or false.</li>
<li>One question is displayed at a time</li>
<li>When they answer a question, the appropriate feedback is displayed; either an encouraging message or explanation with an “I understand” button to continue to the next question</li>
<li>After the feedback is displayed the next question gets generated</li>
<li>I keep track of the user’s name, the number of questions they answered, their score and the time elapsed</li>
<li>At the end of the quiz, if users get an 80 or higher, the user gets a congratulatory message. Else, they get notified that they failed the quiz and are allowed to retake the quiz or exit.</li>
<li>Styled the page using Bootstrap and CSS</li>
<li>The application is hosted on Netlify</li>
