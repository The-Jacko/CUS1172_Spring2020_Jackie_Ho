Project 4: Individual Project Milestone 1  
CUS 1172  
Spring 2020

<ul>
<li>I created a form that gets the user’s name as well as the quiz that they want to take</li>
<li>The users are allowed to choose between “Web Development” quiz or “General Computer Science” quiz</li>
<li>When the user starts the quiz, the application retrieves the questions asynchronously from the JSONPlaceholder.</li>
<li>Each quiz has 20 questions with 5 different question types: multiple choice, fill in the blank, short answer, pictures, true or false.</li>
<li>One question is displayed at a time</li>
<li>When they answer a question, the appropriate feedback is displayed; either an encouraging message or explanation with an “I understand” button to continue to the next question</li>
<li>After the feedback is displayed the next question gets generated</li>
<li>I keep track of the user’s name, the number of questions they answered, their score and the time elapsed</li>
<li>At the end of the quiz, if users get an 80 or higher, the user gets a congratulatory message. Else, they get notified that they failed the quiz and are allowed to retake the quiz or exit.</li>
<li>Styled the page using Bootstrap and CSS</li>
<li>The application is hosted on Netlify</li>
</ul>

How I Deployed:
To deploy on Netlify, I clicked on get started for free, which immediately asks me to link my Github account to the service. After linking my account, I clicked on create a new site which brings me to Githubs website and asks me to select which repository I would like to host. I selected CUS1172_Spring2020_Jackie_Ho repository. I then clicked install and entered my password. Next, I clicked on the repository I just installed and finally clicked deploy. The last thing I did was change the name of my project for a more suitable link. Whenever I need to update my hosted website, all I have to do is make the changes in my files and then commit and push them onto Github and the service provides all the tools to automatically update my webpage for me.
